# ComputationalAstrodynamicsImplementations
My solutions in one of my master's courses' sets. There are two jupyter notebooks. 

The one is about drawing the 24-hour ground tracks for five satellites with initial conditions at t = 0. These Satellites are the ISS, a Sentinel, a Molniya, and two Geosyncronous with one of them being geosationary. The first step was to fill in the functions in the astrodynamicslibrary.py in order to produce the required plots. In the second part of the exercise, proper initial conditions for the Geostationary satellite (a = 42164.0, e = 0.0001, i = 0) such that it is located at the longitude of Thessaloniki were investigated.

The other one is about the porkchop plot of the interplanetary transefer of a spacecraft from Earth to Mars. In order to draw the plot, the solution to Lambert's problem was computed for different departure and arrival moments.
